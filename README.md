# Comparing the accuracy of decision tree and naive bayes for classification on sample dataset
Decision trees and Naive bayes algorithms are trained and tested using `sklearn` to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not. Scikit Learn method `sklearn.metrics` is used to find accuracy based on training and predicted labels. Naive Bayes gives an accuracy of 81% while Decision tree's is 51% on this particular data.
